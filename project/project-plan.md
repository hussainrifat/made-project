# Project Plan

## Title

The Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on COVID-19 Outcomes in South America

## Main Question

How do socioeconomic factors, such as income, education, and healthcare access, correlate with COVID-19 infection rates and mortality in South American countries?

## Description

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted different regions with varying severity, influenced by local socioeconomic conditions. This project aims to examine the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes (infection and mortality rates) and socioeconomic factors (income levels, education, and healthcare access) across South American countries. Identifying potential correlations can reveal how socioeconomic disparities influenced COVID-19's impact and provide insights that can guide public health strategies for future pandemics in similar regions.
